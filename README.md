Have you thought of how the world would be if...
1. You can know the sentiment of someone's posts before even reading the post itself
2. The app knows what you are feelings and assigns your posts an emoji without the need for you to manually add one
3. You can (optionally) add a picture to your posts, as well as liking, editing, and deleting the posts

The FUTURE is here..! Finally, a social media app that knows your feelings. The world has been waiting. I, PRESENT TO YOU, the social media that understands your sentiment...
